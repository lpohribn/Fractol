# Fractol
This project was the opporunity to hone miniLibX skills, to make discover/use the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.

The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974, he based it on the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured".

A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar pattern whatever the scale. Various natural phenomena – like the romanesco cabbage – have some fractal features.

In the project was also realized multithearding and multiprocessing, so you can see two fractals in the same time :)
